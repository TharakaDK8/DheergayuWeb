                  Depression is identified as one of the most common mental
                  health disorders in the world. According to the World Health
                  Organization (WHO) report in 2020, around 264 million suffer
                  from depression disorders around the world. Depression not
                  only impacts the patient but also their families and
                  relatives. If not properly treated, due to these reasons it
                  leads people to hazardous situations. Nonetheless existing
                  clinical diagnosis tools for monitoring illness trajectory are
                  inadequate.

                  Traditionally, psychiatrists use one to one interaction
                  assessments for diagnosis. However, these clinic-centered
                  services can pose several operational challenges. For
                  monitoring depressive disorders, patients are required to
                  travel regularly to a clinical center within its limited hours
                  of operation and these procedures are highly resource
                  intensive because they require skilled clinician and
                  laboratories. To address these issues, we propose personal and
                  ubiquitous sensing technologies, such as fitness trackers and
                  smartphones. which can monitor human vitals in an unobtrusive
                  manner. In recent years, the sensing ability of mobiles and
                  fitness trackers significantly increased. Image processing and
                  machine learning techniques have been used to analyze user
                  contextual data such as heart rate and blood pressure
                  variances, sleeping pattern variances and static and dynamic
                  facial features. By this proposed system we are planning to
                  bridge the gap between high performance modern sensing
                  technology devices and traditional mental health diagnosis
                  steps into a new pre-emptive era.

                  <h5>Literature Review</h5>
                  <p>
                    This part of the literature study will review existing
                    approaches about depression diagnosis. Traditionally
                    psychiatrists are specialized to work in anxiety and
                    depression disorders. It has mainly focused on subjective
                    screening and laboratory-based approaches [5]. Recently
                    there has been an advent of studies into cellular sensor
                    networks and intelligent environments for remote monitoring
                    applications. As a result, a significant portion of
                    researchers have tried to develop mobile apps and social
                    network behavioral patterns to diagnose affective
                    conditions, such as emotion, social alienation and
                    frustration. In this section, in this section, we present
                    relevant works that used to develop health data. The
                    research of CARDIA [6], Fit flex [7] have used wrist-worn
                    actigraphy monitors to collect sleep data. This model has
                    facilitated to measure the sleep parameters of a depressive
                    personnel. The Research of interactive virtual agent-based
                    health care delivery network [8] of SimSei, was able to
                    develop decision making support mechanism through an
                    integrated system. A Reduced Region of Interest (ROI) based
                    research on static facial emotions have used local binary
                    patterns as the extraction technique [9]. The researchers
                    were able to find out the significant six facial features.
                    The heart rate variability research was able to introduce
                    wearable equipment to detect depression based on cardiograph
                    data. [10] Compared to the existing work in mental health
                    monitoring [8,9], “Dheergayu” is distinct in following
                    features, Dheergayu proposes an integrated system for
                    monitoring Depressive Disorders, and the solution
                    centralized with enabling multi-health data capturing and
                    analyzing models. The centralized model be able to sense and
                    produce the severity level of depressive cases.

                    As a result of the literature survey, we identified Clinical
                    Depression detection has been done in several ways. They
                    have used Heart Rate variance and Blood Pressure, Sleeping
                    patterns, Static facial features variance and Dynamic facial
                    features variance as depression monitoring areas. But there
                    are more gaps still need to be filled with doing research in
                    these areas. Problems with the existing systems Previous
                    systems only detect the depression on patients. But they do
                    not provide a continuous monitoring of depression level with
                    providing accurate results considering previous data.

                      ● &nbsp; Previous systems have used medical devices, EEG
                      wearables, and clinical health actigraphy to measure
                      depression. Need of laboratories, special services and
                      special knowledge on usage of equipment makes depression
                      detection process more costly. Because of that reason many
                      patients cannot get the advantage of improvements in
                      technology to get treatments and have a better life by
                      recovering illnesses without spending more money.

                      can be happen when using the system in a real world
                      platform. Because of that reason some important landmarks
                      can be lost, and it effects to the accuracy of the
                      depression detection model. Current research does not have

                    Depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent
                    worldwide. According to the world health organization,
                    depression is the most common illness worldwide and the
                    leading cause of disability [1]. From the survey conducted
                    in the USA it was validated that 50 - 70 million people
                    suffer [19] from sleep disturbances and other depressive
                    disorders. In the current situation some people haven’t idea
                    about depression and haven relevant way to calculate
                    depression level in real-time. However current depression
                    analyzing and diagnosing very objective and not effective at
                    real-world scenarios, some of the accessing methods
                    [20][21], needs laboratory facilities and expensive
                    diagnosis equipment’s to depression detection. These
                    mentioned methods are not practical with dealing these
                    numbers of patient. To overcome this issue, we planned a
                    solution with fitness tracker. However, fitness trackers
                    usages tend users to healthier life but not ability detect
                    early signs of depression stages.

                  <h5>Methodology</h5>
                  <p>
                    This project is about developing a clinical depression
                    assistant which gives depression severity status based on
                    Heart Rate Variability [12], Cyclic Alternation Pattern [13]
                    and Random Eye Movement [14] of sleep, Static facial
                    features [15] and Dynamic facial features [16] of a patient.
                    The stated patient data access from the patient's fitness
                    tracker and Camera of a smartphone via developed
                    application. Under the methodology, reviews the analysis of
                    each health data of a patient, to produce suggestions and
                    further recommendations to improve decision making for
                    caretakers and doctors. The goal of this project design is,
                    assist patients in their difficult situations with the help
                    of minimum user interactions.

                    <br />
                    The availability of empirical data is of vital significance
                    for the evaluation of the research problem. The used
                    datasets are important for model creations and feature
                    extractions. Due to the delicate existence of clinical
                    records, the dataset distribution is neither large nor
                    unrestricted. Under the research of depression analysis, we
                    used the following data sources [17][18][19] [20][21].

                      ● &nbsp; Multi-site Prospective Cohort Study to
                      Investigate Obstructive sleep Apnea (OSA) and depressive
                      disorders 9736 PSGs

                  <h5>Analysis of Static Facial Features</h5>
                  <p>
                    The development of facial image analyzing plays an important
                    role in the face recognition field [25]. As well as the
                    observation of facial emotions of a depression patient is
                    provided huge support for decision making for the treatments
                    by recognizing the depression level of the patient. This
                    analysis of static facial images could give the early
                    mentioned support in an effective way.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Analysis of Dynamic Facial Features</h5>
                  <p>
                    Eye aspect ratio concept which defined in the “Real-Time Eye
                    Blink Detection using Facial Landmarks” research paper which
                    based on the work by Soukupova and Cech [22] used to
                    identify the blinks of the depressed person. This feature
                    only extracts the eye of the provided video and each eye is
                    represented using six coordinates. Fig. 4 Sample eye-blink
                    capturing image, In respectively into p1-p6 facial
                    coordinates. The EAR method used for this feature is
                    mentioned below, EAR value is constant when the eye is open,
                    but the value will drop to zero when a blink occurs. By
                    using the landmark distance (1) this feature has ability to
                    identify the blinks of the depressed person. After
                    identifying the blink count this feature should identify
                    whether this blink count is normal or related to depression.
                    According to [23] depressed people have a low blink rate. It
                    has been reported that the normal spontaneous blink rate is
                    between 12 and 15/min [24]. By getting these mentioned
                    points this feature will generate a report that indicates
                    the depression rate by using the blink rate.

                  <h5>Analysis of Heart Rate Variability</h5>
                  <p>
                    In HRV detection, HRV is the physiological phenomenon of the
                    variation in the time interval between consecutive
                    heartbeats in milliseconds [27]. Using logistic regression
                    model analysis, the HRV, based on the age, gender, blood
                    pressure and HRV rate. Model used fitness band data for its
                    predictions. Model provides 94% of accuracy of the training
                    dataset. According to [28] depression patients have a lower
                    HRV than normal people. and HRV depends on the age limit of
                    the person.

                  <h5>Analysis of Depressive Sleep</h5>
                  <p>
                    Under the study, data [17][18][19] of the total 671
                    participants with evidence of having sleep disorders, 142
                    subjects were selected (Insomnia – 63, Obstructive Sleep
                    Disorder – 36, normal controls - 43). The selected
                    proportion has Sleep Obstructive Disorder (OSA) [29],
                    Insomnia [30]. The subject’s sleep was recorded from
                    Electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, epochs of 30 seconds.
